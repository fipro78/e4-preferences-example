# e4-preferences-example
This project is an example for preference handling in Eclipse 4. 

It uses the OSGi declarative service for contributing preference pages which can be found here: https://github.com/fipro78/e4-preferences

There are two views and a preference page in the example application. The left view uses the preference mechanism of the Eclipse platform,
the right view uses the preference mechanism of e(fx)clipse.
